My dotfiles. The beginnings of a portable environment for my frequent comings and goings between thevarious computers in my life, not to mention the frequent reinstalls that I make.

Basic instructions:

1. After stabilizing the new OS, install and activate git.
2. Clone into this repo.
3. Symlink (ln -s) .vimrc, .tmux.conf, and .zshrc to ~/
4. Install vim, tmux, and zsh.
5. Vim requires powerline, pathogen, and jellybeans to function without throwing an error.


vimfiles repo is on the todo list, coming soon hopefully.
